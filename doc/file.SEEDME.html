<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: always back up any valuable data before running any seed commands.</p>

<h2 id="i-just-want-to-seed-my-deck">I just want to seed my deck</h2>

<p>If you’re starting from scratch, run <code>decko setup</code>. This will create the databases
specified in your database.yml, the tables specified in the decko schema, and the
data specified in the mods.</p>

<p>If you have recently added a mod and need to take in its seed data, run <code>decko update</code>.</p>

<p>If you already have tables but want to start over, you can use <code>rake card:seed:replant</code>,
which will truncate (as in, delete everything from) the existing tables and then
add the seed data.</p>

<p>You can also use Ruby-on-Rails db tasks (eg <code>db:reset</code>, <code>db:drop</code>) for their original
purpose, but caution is advised.</p>

<h1 id="advanced">Advanced</h1>

<p><em>The remainder of these docs are intended as an introduction for Monkeys who may be
creating or modifying seed data. You probably don’t need it if you’re working exclusively
as a Shark.</em></p>

<h2 id="background-seeded-cards-often-connect-code-with-data">Background: seeded cards often connect code with data</h2>

<p>Decko blurs the line between data and code. That is by design, because Decko helps people
who aren’t coders do things that usually only coders do. In Decko terms, we extend the
capacities of sharks (ie advanced web users, so ultimately <strong>data</strong> people) into the
realm of the capacities of monkeys (ie <strong>code</strong> people).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/decko-commons/decko/blob/main/card/lib/cardio/mod.rb">Mods</a> often add cards used to configure things. These cards can
be influenced in data (by sharks), in code (by monkeys), or both. Cards that are
referred to in code have a <strong>codename</strong> used by coders, and those cards are generally
added to decks via seeding.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Monkeys (coders) should never refer to a card in shared code by its name
(which can change) or its id (which can vary from site to site). Instead, they should
always use a <strong>codename</strong>, which is an independent permanent identifier. Often a card’s
codename is the same as its name, but if a user changes the name, the codename remains the
same, so the connection to the code is not broken.</p>

<h2 id="how-seeding-works">How seeding works</h2>

<h3 id="fixtures">Fixtures</h3>

<h4 id="fast-to-load-hard-to-write"><em>Fast to load, hard to write.</em></h4>

<p>Fixtures are fast-loading YAML files that are used by important tasks like <code>decko setup</code>
and <code>rake card:seed:replant</code>.</p>

<p>Every deck is configured with a list of mods that contain fixtures. You can configure that
list in <code>config/application.rb</code> or environment-specific
config files using <code>config.seed_mods</code>. To see the current mod list, you can run
<code>decko runner 'puts Cardio.config.seed_mods'</code>. A default installation will return the
following:</p>

<p><code>
defaults
core
</code></p>

<p>This tells you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Running <code>be decko setup</code> will use fixtures from the <strong>defaults</strong> mod, the first mod on
the list. To see those fixtures, look in the <code>data/fixtures</code> directory of the defaults
mod in the card gem. (You can use <code>rake card:mod:list</code> to see where all your mods are
installed.)</li>
  <li>The defaults mod’s seed data is generated using seed data in the <strong>core</strong> mod.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you were to look in the <code>data/fixtures</code> directory of either the <em>core</em> mod or the
<em>defaults</em> mod, you would find directories of yaml files that correspond to tables in
the database.</p>

<p>The deck described in the <em>core</em> mod is very small: just 11 cards. This is the minimal
seed dataset, and it is the only one in which these fixtures files are edited by hand.
Here is one example of a card in cards.yml:</p>

<p><code>
list:
   id: 4
   name: List
   key: list
   codename: list
   creator_id: 1
   updater_id: 1
   read_rule_class: all
   read_rule_id: 10
   trash: false
   type_id: 3
   db_content: ""
</code></p>

<p>For a card’s representation to be complete, we also need to represent the action
that created it, the act of that action, and any references it makes to other cards.
Each of these involves <strong>lots of ids and repeated fields that are very easy to get wrong
when working by hand.</strong> So generally speaking, the fixtures in the core mod are the <em>only</em>
fixtures that ever get edited by hand (and even that is very rare).</p>

<h3 id="pods">Pods</h3>

<h4 id="easy-to-use"><em>Easy to use.</em></h4>

<p>Because fixtures are hard to write, we almost always generate fixtures from simpler YAML
files in mods’ data directories. The data in these “pod” files are based not on the final
database structure but on the api by which cards are created.</p>

<p>For example, here is how the “List” card described above would look in pod yaml:</p>

<p><code>
- :name: List
  :codename: list
  :type: :cardtype
</code></p>

<p>Pod data are used not only in generating fixtures but also by <code>decko update</code>, which is
used when updating code or installing mods. The idea is that in most cases Monkeys
just need to maintain their mod data in one place.</p>

<p>If you want more nuanced control of which cards you ingest – for example to ingest
only the cards from a given mod – you can use <code>card eat</code> (or
<code>rake card:eat</code>). See <code>card eat -h</code> for more details.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="generating-pod-yaml">Generating pod YAML</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two main ways to generate seed pods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write it by hand</li>
  <li>Export it from your deck using <code>card sow</code></li>
</ol>

<p><em>(See <code>card sow -h</code> for more)</em></p>

<p>Pods can use all the same arguments that are used with <code>Card.create</code> or <code>card.update</code>.
The most common are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>type</li>
  <li>codename</li>
  <li>content</li>
  <li>fields</li>
  <li>skip</li>
  <li>trigger</li>
</ul>

<p>Because pods are ingested using <code>Card.ensure</code> (which creates or updates the card as
necessary), they can also handle the <code>conflict</code> argument, which manages situations where
an existing card differs from the pod. The default conflict handling will override cards
that are “pristine” – that is to say, that have not been directly edited by a user other
than Decko Bot. Setting <code>conflict</code> to <code>defer</code> will mean existing content is never
overridden. Setting it to <code>override</code> will mean it always is.</p>

<p>The eat task also adds support for two additional arguments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user — who is credited with the action. Default is Decko Bot.</li>
  <li>time — when did the action take place. If not specified, uses actual time of action.
Useful for test data (see below). Value is an integer representing
<a href="https://kb.narrative.io/what-is-unix-time">unix time</a>. If prefaced by a “+” or “-”,
we compute a time in the future or past respectively from <code>Time.now</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also use <code>user</code> to specify who should perform the action.</p>

<p>The standard way to ingest card pods is by using <code>decko update</code>, but you can also
use <code>card eat</code> for more control over your meal.</p>

<h3 id="real-vs-test-data"><em>Real</em> vs <em>Test</em> data</h3>

<p>Test data is dummy data added to facilitate code testing. It is not intended to be
included in live sites. <em>Real</em> data, by contrast, <em>is</em> intended for production sites.</p>

<p>When you add seed data to mods, you typically put it in one of two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data/real.yml</li>
  <li>data/test.yml</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a <em>lot</em> of data, you can break them into more files. For example if you want
to add “project” data, you can add them to a file called <code>data/real/projects.yml</code> and then
add a line with <code>- projects</code> in the real.yml file.</p>

<h3 id="updating-fixtures">Updating fixtures</h3>

<p>The primary rake task for updating seed fixtures is <code>card:seed:update</code>. When pods are
updated, you will need to run this <code>update</code> task in order for the fixtures to be updated
and any changes to be reflected in the seed data.</p>

<p>Here’s how the fixtures are updated with <code>rake card:seed:update</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>seed with the existing fixtures</li>
  <li>run <code>decko update</code> to “eat” the pod data, run migrations, and install the mods</li>
  <li>do some minor cleanup of mods / assets</li>
  <li>dump the results to the <code>data/fixtures</code> directory</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that <code>card:seed:update</code> simply loops through the card pods and ensures that they
exist. If you <em>delete</em> pods, it won’t notice. In that case you would need to rebuild
your seed data from scratch using <code>card:seed:build</code>, which starts from the fixtures set
on which the current fixtures set depends. For example, if you were to run
<code>rake card:seed:build</code> from the <em>defaults</em> mod, it would start by seeding from the
fixtures in the <em>core</em> mod. Note that when building, <em>test</em> data fixtures are seeded with
<em>real</em> data. So for deletions of <em>real</em> pod data to be removed from <em>test</em> data, one must 
first  rebuild the <em>real</em> fixtures, and then rebuild the <em>test</em> fixtures that depend on 
them.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-fixtures-set">Creating a new fixtures set</h2>

<h4 id="for-advanced-monkeys"><em>For advanced monkeys</em></h4>

<p>Fixtures sets are for packaged deployments of specific applications that combine many
mods.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re creating a site called <code>mydeck</code>, and you want to install multiple copies
of that deck with the same seed data. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose a mod where you want to save the seed fixtures and add the required
directories in <code>[mymod]/data/fixtures</code></li>
  <li>Add the following line to <code>config/application.rb</code>:
<code>
config.seed_mods.unshift :mymod
</code></li>
  <li>Run <code>rake card:seed:build</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate fixtures that include all your data in addition to the data from the
defaults mod.</p>

<p>If you would like to publish your new seed data in a gem mod, then rather than
configuring the seed mod list in <code>config/application.rb</code>, you will need to configure it
in the gem’s default required ruby file.</p>

<p>For example if you create a gem mod called <code>card-mod-mymod</code>, then inside
<code>lib/card/mod/mymod.rb</code> you will want something like the following:</p>

<p><code>
Cardio::Railtie.config.seed_mods.unshift :defaults
</code></p>
