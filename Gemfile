gem "decko", path: "./"


# DATABASE
# Decko currently supports MySQL (best tested), PostgreSQL (well tested), and SQLite
# (not well tested).
gem 'mysql2', '>= 0.4.4'


# WEBSERVER
# To run a simple deck at localhost:3000, you can use thin (recommended), unicorn,
# or (Rails" default) Webrick
gem "thin"
# gem "unicorn"


# CARD MODS
# The easiest way to change card behaviors is with card mods. To install a mod:
#
#   1. add `gem "card-mod-MODNAME"` below
#   2. run `bundle update` to install the code
#   3. run `decko update` to make any needed changes to your deck
#
# The "defaults" includes a lot of functionality that is needed in standard decks.
gem "card-mod-defaults"


# BACKGROUND
# A background gem is needed to run tasks like sending notifications in a background
# process.
# See https://github.com/decko-commons/decko/tree/master/card-mod-delayed_job
# for additional configuration details.
gem "card-mod-delayed_job"


# MONKEYS
# You can also create your own mods. Mod developers (or "Monkeys") will want some
# additional gems to support development and testing.

gem "decko-cucumber", group: :test
gem "decko-profile", group: :profile
gem "decko-cypress", group: %i[cypress test]
gem "decko-spring", group: %i[test development]


# PLATYPUSES
# This mod is strongly recommended for platypuses â€“ coders working on the decko core
gem "card-mod-platypus", group: :test


# The following allows simple (non-gem) mods to specify gems via a Gemfile.
# You may need to alter this code if you move such mods to an unconventional location.
