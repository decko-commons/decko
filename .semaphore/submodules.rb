# Loop through each git submodule and handle semaphore caching

# Note, this was previously attempted with `git submodule foreach`, but that
# commands assumes submodules have already been cloned with `git submodule update`.
# The point of this optimization is to prevent cloning, so instead we use
# `git submodule status` to produce a status file (one that is also used in other
# semaphore job commands), and then parse that file to get the sha and path we
# need for caching.
#
# Some rough numbers:
#   update submodules: ~45s
#   restore submodules: ~30s
#   times we MUST have all submodules: 2 (rspec/cuke)  ~90s
#   times we currently restore submodules: 4 ~120s
#
# NOTE: a LOT of this time is in bootstrap modules.
#
# I'm taking this away for now, but there are several scenarios where we might decide
# it's useful in the future. Eg, if there are LOTS of different tasks.
