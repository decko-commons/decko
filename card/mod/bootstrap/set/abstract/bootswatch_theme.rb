# Bootswatch themes are free themes for bootstrap available at https://bootswatch.com/.
# For every bootswatch theme we have one card of card type "bootswatch skin".
# They all have codenames following the pattern "#{theme_name}_skin".
#
# The original bootswatch theme is build from two files, `_variables.scss` and
# `_bootswatch.scss`. The original bootstrap scss has to be put between those two.
# `_variables.scss` overrides bootstrap variables, `_bootswatch.scss` overrides
# bootstrap css (variables are defined with `!default` hence only the first appearance
# has an effect, for css the last appearance counts)
#
# The content of a bootswatch theme card consists of four parts:
#   * pre_variables: hard-coded theme independent stuff
#       and bootstrap functions to make the available in the variables part
#   * variables: the content from `_variables.scss`,
#   * post_variables: the bootstrap css and libraries like select2 and
#       bootstrap-colorpicker that depend on the theme
#   * stylesheets: the content from `_bootswatch.scss` and custom styles
#
# For the original bootswatch themes all those parts are hard-coded and the content
# is taken from files.
# The bootswatch theme content is taken directly from the files in the bootswatch
# submodule. For the rest we use code file cards.
# Cards of type "customized skin" have the same structure but make the variables
# and stylesheets part editable.
#
# Bootswatch theme cards are machine cards for the following reason.
# Machine cards usually store all involved input cards of all nested levels in
# there +*machine_input pointer. All those input cards
# are processed separately and the result is joined to build the machine output.
# That's a problem for this card when it's used as input.
# A lot of the items depend on the variables scss and can't
# be processed independently. Therefore we return only self as item card and join
# the content of all the item cards in the content of the bootswatch theme card.
# But then this card has to forward updates of its items to the machine cards it provides
# input for.
# To do that it is a machine itself and stores the generated machine output as its
# content which will trigger the updates of other machines that use this card.
