class Card
  # A _change_ is an alteration to a card's name, type, content, or trash state.
  # Together, {Act acts}, {Action actions}, and {Change changes} comprise a
  # comprehensive {Card card} history tracking system.
  #
  # For example, if a given web submission changes both the name and type of
  # card, that would be recorded as one {Action action} with two
  # {Change changes}.
  #
  # A {Change} records:
  #
  # * the _field_ changed
  # * the new _value_ of that field
  # * the {Action action} of which the change is part
  #
