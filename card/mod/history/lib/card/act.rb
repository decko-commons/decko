class Card
  # An "act" is a group of recorded {Card::Action actions} on {Card cards}.
  # Together, {Act acts}, {Action actions}, and {Change changes} comprise a
  # comprehensive {Card card} history tracking system.
  #
  # For example, if a given web form submissions updates the contents of
  # three cards, then the submission will result in the recording of three
  # {Action actions}, each of which is tied to one {Act act}.
  #
  # Each act records:
  #
  # - the _actor_id_ (an id associated with the account responsible)
  # - the _card_id_ of the act's primary card
  # - _acted_at_, a timestamp of the action
  # - the _ip_address_ of the actor where applicable.
