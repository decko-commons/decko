# All cards have one (and only one) of these three states: real, virtual, and unknown.
#
# - *real* cards are stored in the database (but not in the trash) and have a unique id.
# - *virtual* cards are not real, but they act real based on rules. For example,
#   Home+*editors does a search for all the users who have edited the "Home" card.
#   There are many other similar cards that search for things like references, children,
#   etc. But we don't store all these cards in the database; we generate them dynamically
#   based on the names.
# - *unknown* cards are everything else.
#
# These states are frequently grouped as follows:
#
# - *known* cards are either _real_ or _virtual_
# - *new* (or *unreal*) cards are either _unknown_ or _virtual_
