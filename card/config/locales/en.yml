# I18n 'card' messages for the "en" (English) locale
#
# conventions:
#
#  key name prefixes:
#    'exception_' begins key of text to be used in a raised exception
#    'error_' begins key of text to be added to an error list (usuallly)
#    'search_' begins key of text to be used in CQL search comment
#    'deny_' begins key of text to be used in denying action due to permissions
#    (Not all key names begin with a prefix. In the absence of a prefix,
#    the way the text will be used is generic and not explicitly hinted at.)
#
#  scope:
#    scope values correspond to the path to the source file where the
#    translation lookup occurs, relative to the root of the 'card' gem,
#    with slashes replaced by dots and the final .rb extension omitted.
#    So, a scope might be
#      'lib.card.format.render' or 'mod.01_core.set.all.permisssions'
#    Although there isn't a common prefix for all scopes, scopes begin
#    with either 'lib.card' or 'mod.0d_modname' and these patterns are
#    sufficiently distinctive that key collisions with translations
#    for applications or other gems are believed to be unlikely.
#    Format names for time and date are begun with a 'card_'  prefix to
#    minimize the chances of interference with other gems or applications.
