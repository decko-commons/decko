    # A 'StageDirector' executes the stages of a card when the card gets
    # created, updated or deleted.
    # For subcards, i.e. other cards that are changed in the same act, a
    # StageDirector has StageSubdirectors that take care of the stages for
    # those cards
    #
    # In general a stage is executed for all involved cards before the
    # StageDirector proceeds with the next stage.
    # Only exception is the finalize stage.
    # The finalize stage of a subcard is executed immediately after its store
    # stage. When all subcards are finalized the supercard's finalize stage is
    # executed.
    #
    # If a subcard is added in a stage then it catches up at the end of the
    # stage to the current stage.
    # For example if you add a subcard in a card's :prepare_to_store stage then
    # after that stage the stages :initialize, :prepare_to_validate,
    # :validate and :prepare_to_store are executed for the subcard.
    #
    # Stages are executed with pre-order depth-first search.
    # That means if A has subcards AA and AB; AAA is subcard of AA and ABA
    # subcard of AB then the order of execution is
    # A -> AA -> AAA -> AB -> ABA
    #
    # A special case can happen in the store phase.
    # If the id of a subcard is needed for a supercard
    # (for example as left_id or as type_id) and the subcard doesn't
    # have an id yet (because it gets created in the same act)
    # then the subcard's store stage is executed before the supercard's store
    # stage
