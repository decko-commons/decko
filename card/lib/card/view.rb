class Card
  # Card::View manages {Options view options}, {Cache view caching}, and
  # {Permission view permissions}.
  #
  # View objects, which are instantiated whenever a view is rendered, are available as
  # in views and other format methods.  The view objects can be accessed using `#voo`.
  # We sometimes feebly pretend VOO is an acronym for "view option object," but really
  # we just needed a way not to confuse these Card::View options with the countless
  # references to viewnames that naturally arise when rendering views within views within
  # views.
  #
  # When view A renders view B within the same format object, A's voo is the parent of
  # B's voo. When card C nests card D, a new (sub)format object is initialized. C is then
  # the parent _format_ of D, but D has its own root voo.
  #
  # So a lineage might look something like this:
  #
  # `F1V1 -> F1V2 -> F1V3 -> F2V1 -> F2V2 -> F3V1 ...`
  #
