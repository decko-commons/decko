class Card
  # Card::Query is for finding implicit lists (or counts of lists) of cards.
  #
  # Search and Set cards use Card::Query to query the database, and it's also
  # frequently used directly in code.
  #
  # Query "statements" (objects, really) are made in WQL (Wagn Query
  # Language). Because WQL is used by Deckers, the primary language
  # documentation is on wagn.org. (https://decko.org/WQL_Syntax). Note that the
  # examples there are in JSON, like Search card content, but statements in
  # Card::Query are in ruby form.
  #
  # In Decko's current form, Card::Query generates and executes SQL statements.
  # However, the SQL generation is largely (not yet fully) separated from the
  # WQL statement interpretation.
  #
  # The most common way to use Card::Query is as follows:
  #     list_of_cards = Card::Query.run(statement)
  #
  # This is equivalent to:
  #     query = Card::Query.new(statement)
  #     list_of_cards = query.run
  #
  # Upon initiation, the query is interpreted, and the following key objects
  # are populated:
  #
  # - @join - an Array of Card::Query::Join objects
  # - @conditions - an Array of conditions
  # - @mod - a Hash of other query-altering keys
  # - @subqueries - a list of other queries nested within this one
  #
  # Each condition is either a SQL-ready string (boo) or an Array in this form:
  #    [ field_string_or_sym, Card::Value::Query object ]

    # After conversion, ATTRIBUTES is a Hash where the key is the attribute
    # and the value is the attribute type:
    # { id: :basic, name: :basic, key: :basic ...}
    # This is used for rapid attribute type lookups in the interpretation phase.
    ATTRIBUTES = {
      # Each of the "basic" fields corresponds directly to a database field.
      # their values are translated fairly directly into SQL-safe values.
      # (These are referred to as "properties" in WQL documentation. Need to
      # reconcile #EFM)
