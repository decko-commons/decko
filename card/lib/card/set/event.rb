    # Supports the definition of events via the {Api Events API}
    class Event
      # Events are the building blocks of the three transformative card actions: _create_,
      # _update_, and _delete_.
      #
      # (The fourth kind of action, _read_, does not transform cards, and is associated
      # with {Card::Format views}, not events).
      #
      # As described in detail in {Card::Director}, each act can have many actions, each
      # action has three phases, each phase has three stages, and each stage has many
      # events.
      #
      # Events are defined in set modules in {Cardio::Mod **mods**}. Learn more about
      # {Cardio::Mod set modules}.
      #
      # A simple event definition looks something like this:
      #
      #     event :append_you_know, :prepare_to_validate, on: :create do
      #       self.content = content + ", you know?"
      #     end
      #
      # Note:
      #
      # - `:append_you_know` is a unique event name.
      # - `:prepare_to_validate` is a {Card::Director stage}.
      # - `on: :create` specifies the action to which the event applies
      # - `self`, within the event card, is a card object.
      #
      # Any card within the {Card::Set set} on which this event is defined will
      # run this event during the `prepare_to_validate` stage when it is created.
      #
      # Events should not be defined within format blocks.
