class Card
  # _Views_ are the primary way users interact with cards. Card::Format and its subclasses ({Card::Format::HtmlFormat}, {Card::Format::JsonFormat}, {Card::Format::XmlFormat}, etc) are responsible for defining and rendering _views_.
  #
  # However, Deck-coders (those who code in the Card/Decko framework) rarely write code directly in these classes. Instead they organize their code using {Card::Mods mods}. The {Card::Mod} docs explain how to set up a mod. Once you've done that, you're ready to define a view.  These docs will introduce the basics of view definition and
  #
  # Here is a very simple view that just defines a label for the card â€“ its name:
  #
  #     view :label do
  #       card.name
  #     end
  #
  # If a format is not specified, the view is defined on the base format class, Card::Format. The following two definitions are equivalent to the definition above:
  #
  #     format do
  #       view(:label) { card.name }
  #     end
  #
  #     format(:base) { view(:label) { card.name } }
  #
  # But suppose you would like this view to appear differently in different output formats. For example, you'd like this label to have a tag with a class attribute HTML so that you can style it with CSS.
  #
  #     format :html do
  #       view :label do
  #         div(class: "my-label") { card.name }
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # Note that in place of card.name, you could also use `super`, because this view is translated into a method on Card::Format::HtmlFormat, which inherits from Card::Format.
  #
  # ## Common arguments for view definitions
  #
  # * :perms - restricts view permissions. Value can be :create, :read, :update, :delete, or a Proc.
  # * :tags - tag view as needed.
  #
  # The most commmon tag is "unknown_ok," which indicates that a view can be rendered even if the card is "unknown" (not real or virtual).
  #
  # ## Rendering views
  #
  # To render our label view, you can use either of these:
  #
  #     render :label
  #     render_label
  #
