class Card
  # API to create/update/delete additional cards together with the main card.
  # The most common case is for fields but subcards don't have to be descendants.
  #
  # Subcards can be added as card objects or attribute hashes.
  #
  # Use the methods defined in core/set/all/subcards.rb
  # Example
  # Together with "my address" you want to create the subcards
  # "my address+name", "my address+street", etc.
