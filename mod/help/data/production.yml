    view of any card \nwithout more specific guidance.  You can use it to put forward
    principles of style, \nrules of conduct, or any other help text you think may
    be of use to persons editing \ncontent.\n\nGuide content can be edited in [[*guide|*guide

  :content: "Every Decko card has one and only one __type__.\n\n[[RichText]], [[List]],
    [[Image]], [[Search]], [[JavaScript]], [[User]]... All of these are types. \nTo
    see a given card's type, click its ellipses icon ({{\\_|bridge_link}})\nto go
    to the card dashboard (or \"cardboard\").\n\nTypes are defined with [[Cardtype]]
    cards. For example, the Cardtype card named [[Image]] defines the image\ntype.
    You can create a new type by creating a [[/new/Cardtype|new Cardtype]] card.\n\nTypes
    are a core tool for organizing cards. To decide whether you need\na new type for
    a group of cards, consider whether you want to:\n\n1. ...think up a name for each
    card?\n2. ...create a patterned structure for the group?\n\nAs a rule of thumb,
    if the answer to both is yes, you probably want a new type. There are exceptions,
    of\ncourse: [[\\*autoname|autonaming]], casual [[\\*structure|structures]], etc.\n\nBy
    convention, Cardtype names are usually singular, capitalized nouns. \n\nTo configure
    the structure for a Cardtype,  click the \"Configure\" button on a Cardtype cards
    or edit\nthe type's structure rule in the cardboard of _either_ the Cardtype card
    _or_ of any of the cards of that type.\n\nA Cardtype card cannot be deleted as
    long as there are instances of that type."

  :content: "[[*structure]] rules govern the type and content of cards in a given
    set. The content of\nevery card in the set is a copy of the structure rule's content.\n\nYou
    can create powerful card structures using [[http://decko.org/contextual_names|contextual
    names]].\nSuppose a structure rule for City cards nests a card named \"+Country\".
    This establishes a pattern in\nwhich every City has a Country field.  For example,
    the City card \"Moscow\" would nest a field card\nnamed \"Moscow+Country\" with
    the content \"Russia\". and the card \"Berlin+Country\" could contain \"Germany.\n\nNests
    are easy to create and manage using the nest editor, which can be opened using
    the curly bracket\nicon (\\{{}}). This tool will help you create and configure
    nested fields, both through nest syntax \noptions (which only apply to the fields
    when presented within the structure) and through rules \n(which apply in any context)."
