# Commonly used email steps
#
# To add your own steps make a custom_email_steps.rb
# The provided methods are:
#
# last_email_address
# reset_mailer
# open_last_email
# visit_in_email
# unread_emails_for
# mailbox_for
# current_email
# open_email
# read_emails_for
# find_email
#
# General form for email scenarios are:
#   - clear the email queue (done automatically by email_spec)
#   - execute steps that sends an email
#   - check the user received an/no/[0-9] emails
#   - open the email
#   - inspect the email contents
#   - interact with the email (e.g. click links)
#
# The Cucumber steps below are setup in this order.
